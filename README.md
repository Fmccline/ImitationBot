# ImitationBot
ImitationBot is a bot made to play Psyonix's game [Rocket League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_League) using the framework [RLBot](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot). ImitationBot was trained using machine learning based off of other successful Rocket League bots. I let other RLBots play against each other, and I recorded their gameplay. In an attempt to create my own bot, I used the recorded gameplay to train ImitationBot.
